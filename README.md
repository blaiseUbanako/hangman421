## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
My experience going through this project has been invaluable and I've learnt to always write down pseudo code  before begining to solve any programming challenges
